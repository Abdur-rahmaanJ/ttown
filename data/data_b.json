A whole city on a hill! Imagine the possibilities!\nApart from manual building which requires you to place every piece by yourself, I made a much simpler system - Automatic Hills/Holes. To use them, just pause the game, make a shape of the hill you want, unpause the game, and boom! A hill! You'll have to remove some dirt after that, but it takes about 5 seconds. \nYou can also make holes, and make your inhabitants live in a big hole, evil but cool  .\nSo what are you waiting for? Download the plugin and make some hills on this flat planet! \nWe hope you like it!  \n\nDownload here\nUpdate 2:\n\u2022 Added graphics for winter time\n\nBased on textures by Lobby and Theo",

        "descrip": "Hi there,\ntoday I have a terrain-tool that might be useful for anyone who was ever unnerved by placing  a larger number of deco parking lots before.\n\nYES!\nYour prayers have been answered!\nNow you can finally bring the progress of civilization into your cities and conveniently turn all the ugly and dirty landscape into neatly arranged parking lots.   \nParking lots as far as the eye can see...\n\nThe tool works just like the trees from the terrain menu. You can draw out zones that are filled randomly with 1x1 parking lots or you can pick specific variants to build. The lots do not have any influence on anything. They are pure eye-candy.\nIn case the first build was not varied enough you can just zone over the parts that are bothering you until you reach a satisfying result.\n\nThe graphics were for the most part originally made by Lobby and Theo. I just had the idea and compiled the various lots to form this tool. Most lots are (more or less) the same as the existing deco parking lots, but I added some new ones for the sake of variety.\nIn total, this tool contains 17 different 1x1 lots (from A to Q). One blank lot and 16 lots that are filled with one or two cars.\n\nHave fun!\n\nUPDATE\nThis is a very important update, I highly recommend redownloading to anyone who has downloaded the plugin before!\nThe update fixes the \"auto build\" option in order to prevent the parking lots from spawning when creating a new city with trees.\nSorry, for the inconvenience!",

        "author": "mdk_813",
        "descrip": "Hi folks,\nI've created some simple palms and bushes for the terrain menu.\nThe plugin adds two new entries to the terrain menu, which each include a randomizer as well as several single or grouped palms/bushes to choose directly. It basically works like the in-game trees in the same menu.\nPlease note: The preview image for both entries is the same as for the original trees. I guess this is due to the fact that there is just one standard preview for a randomizer in the game. I'm sorry for that. But at least you can distinguish the plugin by the provided texts.\n\nThe palms and bushes are probably best suited for maps with the sand texture but they also work reasonably well on the original green ground texture.\n\nI would like to give a special thanks to CommanderABab, without whom I would not have been able to complete this plugin!\n\nHave fun!\n\nP.S.: The rocks in the picture below are no part of the plugin. They are original content of the game and can be found in the decoration menu.\nP.P.S.: It would be nice, if Lobby added these rocks to the terrain menu as well. Please \n\nUPDATE\nI have added a new file (Palms_Bushes_terrain.mdk_813_NON_AUTO_BUILD.zip) with \"auto build\":false, which will prevent the palms and bushes from being built automatically alongside the ingame trees when you create a new city. Just replace the old folder with the new one!",

Probably causing a lot of exceptions.\n\nhttp://www.theotown.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2138\n\n\n\nThe red oaks are poison oaks with great pollution influence due to the poisonous itchy substance that emanates from them.  Unfortunately, there is also a great noise influence due to the flocks of birds (crows and aizat  birds) that come to eat the white berries.  The influences don't match, so finding spots to build residential free of pollution and noise is tough.  Industrial doesn't mind them, and commercial doesn't seem to either. \n\n You may want to make a backup of  copy your maps and/or region folder to prevent the spread of this tree to maps you like or have spent a great deal of time on.\n\nBest used on a new city for a challenge using trees of course!  Huge or giant maps will be best, as smaller maps may be completely covered with pollution and noise.  To start a city, you would have to do a great deal of removal first.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw7X9l ... p=drivesdk",

It is intended as a quick commuter train for local or regional transportation.\n\nThis plugin contains:\n- railways (a normal version and a slower version for stations) with bridge frames.\n- functional stations in two variants (one to be placed at the side of a single railway, another to be placed in between two railways)\n- non-functional deco tiles to extend the station platforms.\n- a German-style S-Bahn.\n- a Gravel Decal to extend the railway areas.\n\nI recommend using bridges to cross normal roads in order to avoid unwanted effects.\n\nThe plugin requires the inter-station category by KINGTUT101 to work. You can download it from here:\nhttp://www.theotown.com/forum/viewtopic ... 364#p72364\nPut the downloaded category folder into your plugin folder! Make sure the categories' folder name starts with a 1, so that it is read in by the game before the S-Bahn plugin!\n\nNOTE: If you have already used the earlier version of the platforms for decoration purposes, delete them in your cities and from your plugin folder before installing this plugin!\n\nCredits:\nmdk_813\n@Lobby  & @theotheoderich  (trees)\n@KINGTUT10101 (tram and JSON templates)\n@22Alpha (rails and JSON templates)\n\nP.S.

It's the specialized road and only buses can drive on it. \nThe second one is car road. Only passenger cars can use this road.\nAnd the last one is truck road. Only industrial truck can drive on it.\n\nThis plug-in is WIP. Bridge textures aren't done and there's something like a bug, that buses can drive on two last roads. But I think it'll be fixed soon.  \n\nIf you want to follow the development of the plug-in, click here.\nIf you want to get only bus road that was made by @Matison55557, click here.\n\nUpdate 1:\n\u2022 added bridges\n\u2022 set up of roads' priority\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 2\n\u2022 added bus versions of car and truck roads\n\nNOTE: Since update 1.3.79 old car and truck roads don't allow buses to drive on them. I added two special \"bus\" versions of them.\n\nThanks @theotheoderich and @Lobby for a road texture and @mdk_813 for a colored version.\nDownload:\n\n\n flagroad.plugin\n(45.25 KiB) Downloaded 228 times\n\n",

The rails are built on underground water pipe level and they transfer water too, so don't worry about destroying water systems. You'll need a metro station to allow people to come in the trains. If you have a metro station without connected rails, if won't work (duh). Also, the normal water pipes transfer water to rail systems, via small canals so they can cross to other side of normal pipes.\nI hope you like it, enjoy!\n\nCredits:\n- Original pipes by Lobby & Theo, recolored by KoalaGuy\n- Metro station by @mdk_813 \n- Everything else by KoalaGuy\nDownload here",

Great for suburban areas.  \nWorks just like my medieval zone, it uses ingame buildings but hidden in the menu, and they have new IDs. However this time, instead of x and y I used frame stealing.\n\nDownload\n\nNote that there may be some discussion about whether some buildings would be houses or apartment complexes. I chose buildings for this plugin based on my own opinion, and how I see these buildings. Also, buildings from this plugin can have different populations than their ingame versions, because TheoTown adds a bit of randomness to the population.\n\nHopefully you will enjoy this plugin and find some use for it! You can use the Show your suburbs thread to show how you use this plugin. \n\nThe zone contains:\n39 buildings for level T\n6 buildings for level TT\n5 buildings for level TTT\nAll use ingame graphics.",

Most rural building in this plugin resembles medieval  or simple village architecture. \n\nThis rural plugin features four new village houses, three inspired from Three Little Pigs houses and one rural houses village militias that provides some safety to your villagers.\n\nI have also included village spawners and teepees, but I have set both to auto build: false, teepees is draw ground: true which might look ugly to some users \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, this plugin only have around 1x1 small village buildings that could house from one to five  people. Maybe in the future I could add 2x2 buildings if I am not too lazy... Also all buildings are only level 1since rural folks are just simple minded people.  But you can create level 2 buildings if you want... \n\nIf you want to add your own buildings into rural zone, you are free to do so. Just insert your own building into my custom zone:\"$ruralzone.cesare\".   \n\nHere is the download link:\n\n ruralzone.plugin\n(127.32 KiB) Downloaded 52 times\n\n\n\n\n ruralzone.zip\nHehe forgot the zip :/ (127.14 KiB) Downloaded 87 times\n\n\nAs always, have fun with creating rural villages and I hope to inspire some of you folks to create your own custom plugins.  \n\nCredits\n@Lobby- for the red tank and grass ground texture for custom zone decoration.",

        "descrip": "Hi, I have a present for you all this December. \n\n\n\n\n\nI present to you, folks, Rural Housing. Now you can build homes for the villagers in rural areas. Rural homes can house from one to five villagers depending on the type. \n\nThere are housings that can only house one villager, guess he is a loner and some housings can house two, four or five villagers. \n\nAdvantages of rural housing:\n1. Does not need roads. Hence you can place them on any ground types you want without a road connection similar to rural villages in real life.\n2. No electricity needed. Most of the rural villages are used to a traditional lifestyle and would want to keep it their it their way.\n3.Build is auto false. The rural housing will not build itself as to not impede the building of other level 1 houses. This means that you have more control in placing your rural houses.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1.Low population density. Rural villages are unsuitable if you want a booming population. If you want to control the population you can use rural housing to do it.\n2. Some rural houses still needs water, except for leantos and woodhuts. Means you need a clean water supply for those houses.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of rural housing\n1.Leantos- Colorful roof, fast made shelter but can only house a lonely guy. Lonely people works as lumberjack or hunter in the rural community.\n2.Woodhuts- Rural house made of planks and wood, can only house two people\n3.Shanty house- Big brother of woodhut.\n4.Bomb ruins- A remnant of some old war, some villagers still choose to live inside it.\n5.Skumole-A place for reformed criminals, inspiration from Skumole Shack in GTA VC.\n6.Stonehut- A medieval stone hut, probably houses a wizard family or a group of farmers.\n7.SHC hovels- Replica of hovels from Stronghold Crusader that will house some peasants.\n8.Wood resind- Two villagers and three workers. This is just a test to see if workers can fit in a residential type.\n\nThis rural housing pack also includes pedestrian spawners. Pedestrian spawners use the woodhut and hovel texture. Also, I want to give credit to @KINGTUT10101  for the json code on pedestrians, since I used his code to experiment with my own residential pedestrian spawner.\n\nDownload rural housing pack here:\n\n ruralhousing.zip\n(57.39 KiB) Downloaded 109 times\n\n\nAgain, feel free to try my plugin. I hope you guys have fun with it. Also Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all Theonians.",

This mod is still not finished and more updates will come soon like:\n- More caravans & tents\n- More facility buildings like tabletennis table\n- Reception\n- Special camping entrance & wall\n\nWalls\nAlthough there are currently no walls for the campsite, you can still use these:\nSound walls 1.2: viewtopic.php?f=63&t=3394\nModular park walls by mdk_813\nviewtopic.php?f=63&t=3838\n\nIncludes\n- Grassy road\n- 2 Empty places\n- 4 Caravan places\n- 3 Tent places\n- Volleyball field\n- Campfire\n- Spawning caravans\n\nUpdates\nV1.0\n- Grassy road\n- 2 Empty places\n- 4 Caravan places\n- 3 Tent places\n- 1 Camping facility\n\nV1.1\n- Added campfire (with animation)\n- Changed some textures\n- Added no water & power needed for places\n- Added water pump to some places\n\nV1.2\n- Added special camping category\n- Added smoke to campfire\n\nV1.3\n- Added some variety in trees (Thanks to mdk_813)\n- Added driving cars with caravans (Experimental)\n- Deleted the edges at water",

As my building is not an exact replica of this real-life counterpart, I decided to give it a different name that celebrates our favorite game and its creator(s).\nThe building comes in four variations, three TT-residentials and one TT-commercial office building, each on 3x3-lots, which differ in height and appearance.\nI used a tree by Lobby & Theo in two of the variants.\n\nPlease note:\nI have made slight changes to the roofs of the red and yellow buildings by now, which are not reflected in the preview image (sorry, I was to lazy to update the image).\n\nHave fun!\n\nUPDATE:\nI adjusted the shadows a bit, so that the building has some more shape. Please replace your existing folder with the new one provided here!\nPlease also note, that I did not the upate the preview image below.\n\nUPDATE 2:\nI've added a second version of the plugin with ingame trees instead of palmtrees. Both plugins are interchangeable, so no need to bulldoze existing houses in your city, but you cannot use both versions at the same time. So, if you want to turn your city into a palm-free zone than download the second version and replace your existing folder ",

        "descrip": "Hi guys,\nI've created a Gas Station Pack that contains four variants of gas stations from different oil-companies.\nThe  gas stations are 3x3 level-1 commercial buildings with 40 workers.\nThe buildings were designed by me, but the cars used on the lots are some of the original cars from Theotown made by Lobby and theotheoderich.\nThe tarmac texture was also created by me, but it is designed to align with the commercial parking lot pieces in the decorations menu.\nIn sandbox mode the gas station appears as one entry with four options to choose.\nIn simulation mode the four variants should build randomly.\n\nIf any problems occur, especially in simulation mode, please let me know!\n\nUPDATE:\nI realized that the scale of the building was a bit of. As people are 3 pixels tall in Theotown, the windows and roofs of the gas stations were too high. So I lowered them a bit. This is really only a minor change and if you are not bothered by the original scale, then there is no real need to download the new version.\nBut if you do want to update the plugin, then you only need to replace the old pngs in your plugin folder with the new ones provided in this update, because the json was not changed.",

I think it looks a bit more realistic now.\nThanks to @actemendes for giving us the tip with using textures of real buildings. I did not do it that way, but it inspired me to look more closely at architectural photos in order to understand the reflections on glassfronts better.\n\nI strongly recommend updating the file to everyone who has downloaded it before, by replacing the old folder with the new one provided here.

I was inspired by a VW factory on the outskirts of my hometown.\nIt is 7x7, so if you will place the default 6x6 blocks of zones, it will not spawn. You have to make a zone of 7x7 square or bigger. \nIt is level 3 (TTT) and can give job to a whopping 2444 workers. I think it's way too much, to be honest. But what do you think about the building?\n\n\n\ncarfactory.png (31.8 KiB) Viewed 943 times\n\n\n\nGoogle drive, because I can't upload the zip file for some reason:\nDownload",

        "author": "mdk_813",
        "descrip": "Hi,\nhere I have a Breakwater/Seawall Set for your coastlines. It appears in the park menu.\nIt contains a set of straights (with and without a signalling lamp), inner corners, outer corners (all to be placed on the water tile next to the shore) and an endpiece (to be placed on land).\nYou have to rotate the pieces to the desired orientation and puzzle together your custom coastlines. It might seem a bit complicated but it gets pretty easy and quick once you get the hang of it \nPlease note that the seawall only looks good, if the coast tile next to it is covered by another piece from the game, a street or a plaza etc. Bare land next to the pieces will leave gaps and look weird. ALternatively, you can also place the pieces back to back in order to create slimmer dams.\n\nThe Set is inspired by a Set for Simcity 4 which was made by a player named Jeronij: http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filed ... lotGET=112\nHowever, I modeled all the pieces in this set from scratch for Theotown.\n\nThe set is, in my eyes, equally well suited for urban and for more rural or industrial settings (See images below).\n\nHave fun!\n\nUPDATE:\nThanks to @KoalaGuy , we now also have a linetool version of the seawalls:\nhttp://www.theotown.com/forum/viewtopic ... 034#p71034\nI recommend using them together with my original puzzle pieces (zip file below). There is no need to remove or replace the old version.",

They are just static 1x1 decoration tiles without a ground texture.\n\nThe set includes a main battle tank, and armoured fighting vehicle, a small Humvee and an attack helicopter both parked and \"flying\"\nThe rotors of the helicopter are based on/made by Lobby and Theo.\n\n____\nPlease note:\nAs the military base is an IAP and as I do not wish to compete with this, I decided to make the military headquarters and the military tankbase respectively as requirements for these deco-tiles.\nTherefore, here I explicitly prohibit any changes to the json or the png-files of this plugin, because it would just be unfair.\nThat means: You cannot use this plugin unless you have purchased the original Military Base Addon before!\n____\n\nUPDATE\nI've added a green camoflage version of the tanks.

    "TV Tower mdk_813 UPDATE [public]": {
        "author": "mdk_813",
        "descrip": "Hi guys,\nhere I have a TV Tower on a 2x2 lot which appears in the public menu.\nThe tower is loosely based on the Olympic Tower in Munich which was constructed for the Olympic Games of 1972. Today, it is still a well-known landmark and a popular tourist attraction due to its viewing plattform and its revolving restaurant.\n\nIn the game, the tower will act as a super-radio station that offers considerable influence on management, low education, park, religion and sport. It can only be build once in a city and it has certain requirements, namely the rank \"big city\" and the regular radio station (meaning the radio station must exist in your city).\nI wanted to set the upgraded radio stations also as requirements, but it turned out that the game does not offer that option, so I restricted the requirements to the rank and the regular radio station only, while reducing the influence radius a bit, in order to balance that out.\nThe price of the TV tower is 30000T and it costs 150T per month.\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n TV_Tower_2x2_mdk_813.zip\n(15.33 KiB) Downloaded 616 times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\nDue to the help of Lobby I was able to make a taller version of the TV Tower, which probably looks more realistic.\nIt does not replace the earlier small version, it is rather an additional plugin that you can use independently from the earlier one. So, that means you can have both towers or choose the one you like better. I did not bother to change the lot or anything, because you probably won't build both towers right next to each other anyway.\n\nPlease note:\nBecause of the building height larger than 256px a minor display error occurs. The building pops up a bit too late at the lower end of the screen when you scroll. I don't think this is a problem really, but you should be aware of that issue and probably don't use this version if it bothers you too much.\n\nThe taller tower also has some other stats:\n- it requires rank \"Metropolis\" and the regular radio station.\n- it has a larger influence radius (value 475 instead of 400)\n- its price is 35kT and monthly cost is 200T (so, it is a bit more expensive)\n- it can only be built once (but you can have both the small and the tall tower at the same time)\n\n\n\n TV_Tower_tall_2x2_mdk_813.zip\n(16.3 KiB) Downloaded 457 times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Re: Modular Park Sets by mdk_813 [park] UPDATE": {
        "author": "mdk_813",
        "descrip": "\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSo guys,\nI've got a BIG one for you today:\nThe Modular Park Set by mdk_813\n\nThis set is so extensive, I decided to split it up into five parts. You can download all of them or you can select the parts that you want and leave out those which you do not need or want.\nIn total the sets contain 94 individual pieces that are grouped in 27 entries in the park menu. This might seem a bit overwhelming but I tried to group them logically, so don't worry.\n\n----\nBefore we look closer at the different sets, here is some possibly useful advice about placing puzzle tiles, as I understand that this can get tedious:\nIt is usually a good idea to determine the rough shape of what you want to build by placing the corner pieces first. This helps in deciding which pieces need to be put in which spot. Then you continue with intersections and if provided endpieces. Finally, you place the straights. Following these steps could probably spare you from having to switch back and fourth between different pieces all the time \n----\n\nSo, here is a rundown of what the sets contain:\n\n- Modular Park pt.1 (Trees):\nThis Set can be considered the basic Starter Set. It contains simple 1x1-park lots. a lot with grass, some different trees and palms and a flowerbed.\nThe trees were originally made by Lobby and Theo, I simply adjusted the tree foundation in some of the lots. The grass, the palms and the flowerbed are mine. Actually, the palms can be also found in my palms and bushes plugin for the terrain menu which you can find here: viewtopic.php?f=58&t=3739\nThe concrete texture is modeled to align with Lobby's and Theo's concrete-park tiles, but it is infact a different texture generated by me. The palms come both on the grass texture and on the concrete texture. The latter allow you to use them between the lanes of avenues for example.\n\n\n Modular_Park_pt1_trees_mdk_813.zip\n(67.12 KiB) Downloaded 578 times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Modular Park pt.2 (Parkway):\nThis Set contains a number o1x1-tiles that allow you to create parkways and squares. It uses the same concrete texture which blends in with the one by Lobby and Theo.\nThe slim parkway iincludes straights, straights with bench and lamp. corners, crossings and  T-intersections.\nThe wider Square-pieces include Straights, straights with bench and lamp, outside and inside corners, T-Intersections and semi-T-Intersections (which open up to the left or the right respectively). All of these square-pieces allow you to place original park-tiles from the game next to them in order to create, as the name suggests, larger squares.\n\n\n Modular_Park_pt2_parkway_mdk_813.zip\n(163.82 KiB) Downloaded 535 times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n@KoalaGuy turned the narrow parkway into a road, which you can find here:\nviewtopic.php?f=63&t=3838&p=64004#p64004\nThank you!\n\n...",

(45.72m) it is the highest flag pole in the country. It is in the location where the Philippine flag was hoisted on July 4, 1946, when full independence was achieved from the United States. (The Philippines gained first independence from Spain on June 12, 1898).\n\n2. Philippine flag - A horizontal bicolor of blue and red; with a white equilateral triangle based at the hoist containing three, 5-pointed gold stars at its vertices, and an 8-rayed gold sun at its center.\nRoyal blue field symbolizes peace, truth, and justice.\nScarlet red field symbolizes patriotism and valor. When red field is on top, it means the country is in state of war.\nWhite triangle symbolizes equality and brotherhood.\nThree stars on the corners of the triangle symbolizes the three main geographical regions of the country namely Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao.\nThe sun at the center of the triangle has eight rays representing the eight Philippine provinces that started the revolt against Spain.\n\n3. Dr. Jose Rizal Monument - It is the most securely guarded public monument in the Philippines being continuously guarded by Philippine Marine Corps Marine Security and Escort Group. The monument consists of a standing bronze sculpture of the Rizal, with an obelisk, set on a stone base within which his remains are buried. Jose Rizal fought against Spaniards not by guns nor swords but by pen and papers. His writings, particularly the Noli me Tangere (The Social Cancer) and El Filibusterismo (The Reign of Greed) were viewed as the guiding force for other patriots to rally for the Philippine Revolution.\n\n4. Shrine of Valor - The memorial shrine complex was built to honor and remember the gallantry of Filipino and American soldiers who fought during World War II. The white Memorial Cross stands as a remembrance to the soldiers who fought and lost their lives in the Battle of Bataan. \n\n5. Memorial to the Heroes - Mother Philippines - It is a memorial honoring the Filipinos who lived and died in defiance of the repressive regime that ruled over the country from 1972 to 1986. Depicting the self-sacrifice of a fallen figure of a man, held in one hand by the rising figure of a woman who symbolizes the Motherland, while her other hand reaches for the glorious sun of freedom. \n\nHere is the link:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ggfhqfywrfj76 ... k.zip?dl=0\n\nI dedicate these plug-ins to the patriots who fought for independence from foreign oppressors; To the courageous who revolt against the regime of ruthless homegrown tyrants to restore the freedom and democracy; And to the braves who offered their lives while fighting for peace against terrorism and extremism encroach in our nation. Your ultimate sacrifices are never forgotten.\n\nAng mamatay ng dahil sa iyo (For us, thy sons to suffer and die).",

But, it also costs a bit more and it requires a city rank of 7.\nSo, nothing good comes free, right?\n\nI wasn't able to determine whether the blue or the grey version was better, so I decided to offer both for download. You can choose your favorite or you can use both at the same time, which I would probably recommend as long as you have enough plugin texture to spare, because it would increase building variety.\nThe plugins also include trees and an emergency vehicle by Lobby and Theo.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Both versions require the MyRedLight animation, which you need to download separately from here:\nviewtopic.php?f=73&t=4476\nYou cannot use the hospitals without this animation, because otherwise it would produce an error and the game won't start!!!\n\nHave fun!",

        "descrip": "\n\n\n\n\n\nHi,\non this date I would like to publish a special plugin:\nThe Twin Towers of the former World Trade Center in New York City.\n\nToday is the 16th anniversary of one of the most severe terror attacks in history which took thousands of lives. Their aftermath caused even more suffering and influences global politics even up to this day.\nDuring my childhood, the Twin Towers of the WTC had always been sort of the epitome of a skyscraper. Whenever I heard that term \"skyscraper\", I had a picture of these towers in my mind, and I still admire their clean and elegant architecture today. Therefore, I thought it fitting to release this plugin on this date in order to commemorate the towers and the events that will always be connected to them.\n\nThe Set consists of two separate plugins which will appear in the award menu. The first plugin includes the two towers, each on a 4x4 lot and the second includes some 1x1 park tiles and a 2x2 sculpture. The tree on one of the 1x1 lots was made by Lobby and Theo.\nAll buildings require the rank \"big city\" to be built, and the towers can only be built once.\n\nNote also that the towers are not to scale, even though they exceed the recommended maximum building height for plugins of 256px by far. This extreme height has the downside of causing the buildings to pop in or out of view quite abruptly at the bottom of the screen in lower zoom stages when you scroll across the map. If that bothers you, don't download this plugin!\n\nPLEASE, do not start any political discussions below!\nI understand that this subject might be controversial, but this is not the right place for any of that.\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n WTC_mdk_813.zip\n(107.71 KiB) Downloaded 910 times\n\n\n\n\n WTC_park_mdk_813.zip\n(23.91 KiB) Downloaded 711 times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "descrip": "Hi my fellow Theonians,\nthis one might be one of my last plugins for an unforeseeable time, as I will have much less time for personal stuff in the coming months due to professional reasons.\nBut in the meantime, I would like to finally share my Sunken Highway Walls, which some of you might have seen already on a screenshot in another thread some weeks ago. I've been pondering over this plugin for a long time now, considering to change this and that, but now I realized, that most likely I won't do anything more to it. So I thought, I might as well release it now, before forgetting all about it. The walls are probably not perfect, but some of you might find them useful anyway.\n\nThe plugin can create the illusion of a layered surface. It works different to Kingtut's Elevated Terrain in that it is purely fake-3D. It does not actually add a an additional level of terrain, it just looks that way. You can use it to create the appearance of both a higher and a lower level (see images below).\n\nThe set contains five different rotation aware puzzle pieces, that you will have to place one by one. (Sorry, a linetool is not possible here. Believe me, I've tried it...):\n- a straight piece\n- an outer corner\n- an inner corner\n- a right end\n- a left end\nI recommend using the end-pieces next to crossing bridges to make a believable transition, as underbridge-pieces are not possible, as far as I know.\n\nThe pieces have a minimal (monthly) price, but of course you can set these to 0 in the json if you choose so.\n\nOf course, You can use these walls with any street-type, not only with highways, or even without any road at all.\n\nHave fun!",

        "author": "mdk_813",
        "descrip": "\n\n\n\n\n\nHi folks,\nas one of the most popular plugins for theotown, the flags by \"Sometheotown mayor\", won't be developed any further, I decided to release my personal flag plugin which I made quite some month ago. It was initially part of my Modular Park Set but I've never released it so far (Look at the screenshot of the Modular Park and you'll see it! It's funny that nobody ever noticed it  ).\n\nThe set contains numerous flags of different countries that use \"draw ground\". That means, the game\u2019s ground texture will be visible.\nIf you want to place the flag on another texture, I recommend you use Josh\u2019s \u201cground\u201d decals, because they will allow you to place different textures beneath these flags inside the game.\nHere is a link to @Josh \u2019s decals:\nviewtopic.php?f=76&t=4654\n\nThe foundation of the flagpole is taken from the game and was made by Lobby & Theo.\n\nPlease note, that I won't take any requests to make additional flags, because I just don't have any time for that!\nHowever, below I'll provide you with templates (PSD and TIF as well as the JSON) to create your own flags.\nYou can use free applications  like GIMP or Paint.net (plugins may be necessary) to open and edit these template images. The JSON can be edited with Wordpad on Windows for example. I\u2019m sure, there are options to edit these files on Android as well (if you know some apps, please write a comment below!)\n\nHow to use these templates:\nThe template images contain several layers (listed here from bottom  to top):\nthe flagpole\nthree layers for each flag size (6px, 7px and 8px. Pick the one you need according to the complexity of your flag!):\n\tan example layer .\na bright green layer reserved for your personal design (paint here! You only need the base-colors!).\na layer for lights and shadows (Don\u2019t touch this!).\nRemember: Only work on the bright green layers! Pick the colors you need and paint over the green flag. Note that the flag is bend due to the wind so that your flag design needs to have some steps in it (Consult the example layers to see what I mean)\nSave your finished flag as a PNG-file. Use the naming structure that I have provided and replace \u201cYOURCOUNTRY\u201d and \u201cUSERNAME\u201d according to your flag.\nInside the json, you also have to replace \"YOURCOUNTRY\" and \"USERNAME\" the same way. Make sure the file name specified in \"frames\" is exactly the same as the name of the image which you created before! Then, save the json and again replace \"YOURCOUNTRY\" and \"USERNAME\" accordingly.\nFinally, put your PNG and JSON into a folder, which you give the same name as the JSON (without the file-extension). Then pack this folder to a zip-file and transfer it to your device.\nYou are free to share your creations in this thread below as zip-files (and nowhere else!). It is important that you adhere to the provided naming convention, in order to avoid conflicts with the flags of other users.\nPlease add a screenshot from the game so that people can see what they're downloading!\n\nHave fun!",

        "author": "mdk_813",
        "descrip": "\n\n\n\n\n\nHi,\nthis time I would like to present a selection of traffic barriers which you can use for your highways, but also avenues and other road types.\nIt consists of three separate plugins so that you can select the parts you want to use and leave out those which you won't need. \n\nHere are the three parts:\n\n\n\n traffic_barrier_median_Linetool_mdk_813.zip\n(18.18 KiB) Downloaded 715 times\n\n\n\nThis is probably the basic and most important part, which works fine on its own, i.e. even without the other two parts.\nIt adds median barriers which are intended to be placed between the lanes of a highway.\nIt consists of two linetools, one with lamps, one without lamps. Personally I think the spacing between the lamps in the linetool is too narrow, but I included it anyway, because some people might feel different about it. But I also added a rotation aware puzzle piece with a lamp that allows you to create variable spacings between the lamps.\nTo use this you would want to draw a barrier with the linetool without lamps first and then put the single lamp piece over it whereever you want a lamp to be. I suggest to place on every second tile (see example picture above). As long as you don't draw over it with the linetool again, the barriers will retain a correct transition to the puzzle pieces.\n\n\n\n traffic_barrier_single_mdk_813.zip\n(26.61 KiB) Downloaded 534 times\n\n\nThis is an optional part. It adds puzzle pieces of single barriers which are intended to be placed at the sides of the lanes. I wanted to make these as linetools, too, but unfortunately map rotation wouldn't work due to the asymmetry of the tiles. So I had to stick to rotation aware puzzle pieces.\nNote that outer corners are not included because they are unnecessary. Just leave the outer corner tiles empty.\n\n\n\n traffic_barrier_single_Soundwall_mdk_813.zip\n(43.88 KiB) Downloaded 538 times\n\n\nThis is another optional part. It acts as an addon to my New Soundwalls plugin: viewtopic.php?f=70&t=4279\nEssentially, these pieces are the same as the above single barriers just with Soundwalls added to them. You can use these pieces in conjunction with my New Soundwalls in places where you want to have a barrier at the side of the roads. Again, a linetool is not possible here unfortunately.\nThese pieces have the same noise reductive function as the New Soundwalls.\nPlease note, that here you would have to place the provided outer corner (OC) tiles.\n\n\nBelow is an overview of the included tools and pieces:\n\n\n\n\n",

So, if you placed everything correctly, the purple and orange colors should be hidden by the other pieces.\n\nThe single greenhouse costs 2000T and the modular pieces cost 1000T each.\n\nThat's it basically.\n\nHave fun!",

The animals will, if the enclosed area is greater than 3 tiles wide by 3 high and up to 70x70, 50x100, etc.  They spread when yellow, spread more when red, turn green when dead.  The land animals remove themselves when the last yellow one ceases to exist.  If there are no road limiters, you will have to pause the game and remove them yourself once they cease spreading.\n\nRemember, they will eat just about anything except roads, bridges, and public buildings.",

It's actually a terrain type. That also means, you can place things on it! How awesome. And if you place buildings that don't have their ground drawn, you can still see the plaza. I think this is a good way to implement even more detail in TheoTown cities, so I will release more placeable props for this plaza, like potted trees, small fountains etc.\n\nHope you enjoy\n\n\n\n An example of putting decorations on the plaza. \n",

        "descrip": "Hi folks,\ntoday I have some New Soundwalls for you which are not puzzle pieces but a linetool that uses \"frame alignment\" and works just as the road tools do.\n\nIt is a complete rework of my first plugin for Theotown, which back then I could not have done without the help of Dusko who kindly provided a json file.\nYou can find the old Soundwalls here: viewtopic.php?f=63&t=3394\nHere you can follow the initial development of the old plugin: viewtopic.php?f=34&t=3384\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this rework:\n- I wanted to turn the Soundwalls into a linetool to make their placement much easier.\n- The Soundwalls have reworked textures so that they look less plain now.\n- The shadows have been reworked so that the \"dent\" from the shadows of the original walls is eliminated.\n- The new Soundwalls now have the ability to form X- and T-intersections.\n- I plan on including the Walls in a future plugin, but unfortunaley Dusko has been unreachable for quite some time now, so it became necessary to create a whole new plugin.\n\nAs I've said, the New Soundwalls are a linetool which you can use to draw walls the same way as you would draw a road.\nIt still has a noise reductive function but it is now part of the deco menu (whereas the old walls were in the park menu).\n\nHave fun!\n\nP.S. Dusko, if you read this, we miss you here!",

This plugin adds random disasters, and even better, you can customize it! After you place the building found in disasters category, you can select the chance of disasters to spawn (from 0.25x to HELL), also you can choose which disasters should spawn and some other options (currently only Russian Roulette).\nI hope you like it! \nPlease comment your thoughts about the customizable settings which I added, because I really like it. \n\nTested by: DSA Disaster Engineers and KoalaPlugins team.\n\nHow to install in your city:\n1. After installing the plugin, place the building from disasters category somewhere in your city, I recommend the end of the map.\n2. Unpause the game and wait until you get a notification \"Disastrous Disasters plugin has been installed!\"\n3. Adjust the settings how you like. \nThe yellow light tile shows current state ( yellow - settings not set up, red - missing tiles, green - working), the \"0x\" shows current chance for disasters to spawn,tap on it to adjust the chances, tap on the settings tile to adjust which disasters can spawn and tap on tile with red X to reset settings. Have fun!\n\nPlease remember that this plugin is still under beta testing!!!\n\nDownload BETA here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To those two guys who already downloaded it: Sorry please download again!",
