      An old fort that serves as a reminder of your city's colonial past.
I based the design of this fort after the Morro Castle in Havana, Cuba, as well as some forts in the capital of my country(namely Ft Charlotte).
Anyway, I hope you all like it~.

      Hi,
these are the pyramids that I've already showcased in the screenshot section: viewtopic.php?p=69130#p69130
They are awards that require the museum to be in your city first and cost 10k and 20k respectively.
Beware, they take up a significant amount of plugin space as they are 6x6 and 8x8 tiles big.

Have fun!

      hey there mayor, how do you dOoo?...

it's time for us rich people of your city to have our own places of entertainment. we demand an Opera theatre!


FEATURES:
-most importantly this building will add a new category which's entertainment, it's a TTT building
also it has culture influence 100 and park influence 50.
- i'm planning to add more buildings to this category in the future and it will be for all levels.

CREDIT:
-the texture of the cars/trees belongs to original developers (Lobby & Theotheoderich).
-if you like to contribute in possible updates you have my gratitude also i'll add your name and give you credit.

 please check back once in a while for updates.

Regards.
.
.
- UPDATE:
-separated the the category plugin from the opera building plugin so i can add more plugins to this category later on. also did general texture enhancement to the building and parking lot. more shadows added. it's level TT now with more workers and the cost been reduced. you guys didn't like the first building but now i hope these changes make you happy.

***PLEASE DELETE ORIGINAL PLUGIN AND DOWNLOAD BOTH OF THESE PLUGINS***
.here's the plugin, enjoy.

Hello fellow TheoTown players,
Here is my "Statue of Liberty" plugin made using services provided by good guy Google. The texture is made from 3D view of New York found on Google Earth, so it is not perfect. You can find a lot of mistakes, but I like it so I'll just say the building is very old  .
It is a 8x8 award with a big park and culture influence.
You find it on Google Maps/Earth by typing 40.689097,-74.044381
From Google Earth:






Grass is made by @mdk_813 
Enjoy!

      hello,  

-i finished building my first plug-in 3 days ago(note that it has many imperfections and a lil off scale and measurement).had it for 2 days in my game files without any issues, there is nothing i can add to it. there were few details that i wanted to add but due to size limitation i couldn't. also i wanted to add smoke so bad but it's a lil complicated for me. maybe in future.
-i realize that when it comes to real life sizes of machinery and the hole itself is far away from being realistic and that's why i said "small diamond mine".   
-originally it was in the industrial section but the game gave it level 1 with 5000 workers which it wasn't what i intended. i tried doing something about it in json file but the game wasn't responding so i moved it to type "public", of course you can always change it back to industrial so i added the code "auto build false" in case you did, you don't want to see a hole randomly spawning in your map   .

CREDIT
-the texture around the hole belongs to original developers ( Lobby & Theotheoderich
 )
- i did use mdk animation code. find out more in this link viewtopic.php?f=73&t=4476

-i did use a small part or stripe consist of about 9X5 pixels from random image i found in internet, to give it a realistic texture and natural gradual colors. as i do not wish to bring any kind of problems to developers i will not publish the link to download plugin until they give me their approval

regards.

GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!...we got the approval and here's the link, enjoy.

      Today, I have a big building for you, it's a statue of "Guard of Meow", also called " a cat". 
It's not a 2000 lines complex plugin, it's a cultural building for your inhabitants (including cats). I haven't spent much time on this one, just wanted a cat in my city. Do you want a cat in your city? Yes, you do, I can see you smiling 
Real life height would be about 101,333333... meters, don't climb on it, falling may hurt! 
It costs 100,000T to build with a monthly price of 10T, and it requires a rich population of 1,000 (they must own cats tho!). It has "draw ground":true, so using Terrain Paint plugin, @Josh's or @Matison55557's decals is recommended!
Enjoy!

Some questions you may ask, and my answers:
Q - Why did you make this?
A - I made this because I was live streaming with this song playing, so I built a beach called "La Cat", then I suddenly wanted to build a giant cat.

Q - Why does it cost so much?
A - Building a 101m high cat isn't easy, ya know.

Q - Why is it so big?
A - Why not?

Q - Meow meow?
A - Meow, meow meow meow.

Q - This building is ugly!
A - That's not a question, silly.

      Hey guys,
did you hear what happened the other day? I'm telling you, strange things are going on in good ol' Theotown...

This time I have a little treat for all TV-show junkies on here:
Rumor has it, that this plugin is the headquarters of some sinister government agency which performs top-secret psychic experiments. But nobody knows for sure, of course...
The only things that are really known about it are probably these:
The building sits on an 8x8 lot. Yes, 8x8, man up! It seems to be an award and it obviously requires the military missile silo to be built (well, that sounds reasonable...).

The plugin also contains trees and cars by Lobby and Theo!

You also need MyRedLight animation, which you can download below:

For more information go here: viewtopic.php?f=73&t=4476
THE BUILDING WON'T WORK WITHOUT THIS ANIMATION PRESENT IN YOUR PLUGIN FOLDER!
BUT, IF YOU ALREADY DOWNLOADED THE ANIMATION BEFORE, DON'T DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN!


Well, you know...
To a bright future!

Yes, I'm a bad example. No chance to deny it. I'm sorry.
I added the necessary credits.

    Offshore Oil Platform mdk_813 [award]

      Hi,
here is another award-building, I was sitting on for quite a while now. I decided to finally release it now, because I'm unsure what else I could do to it.
It is a 6x6 offshore oil drilling platform, that is awarded as soon as you have both the large oil tanks and the large oil refinery in your city which are growable industrial buildings in the game.
The oil rig itself is purely eye candy, it does not have any influences.
You can build the oil rig three times in your city.
The oil rig only builds on water.

The design, by the way, is loosely based on the Norwegian "Troll-Stations" from Statoil.

PLEASE NOTE:
Again, just like with my hospital plugin, you must download the animation file provided in the following thread and add it to your plugin folder:
viewtopic.php?f=73&t=4476
The oil rig does not work without this animation!
However, if you've already downloaded this plugin before and if you've added it to your plugin folder, you do not need to download it again.
Anyone else will need to download this animation to make the oil rig work!

Have fun!

    WTC Twin Towers mdk_813 [award]
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-pic">
     <img class= "plugin-img" src="http://www.theotown.com/forum/download/file.php?id=3500&t=1&sid=2f9e65821cf86342e2b26d38e4f001d5">

Hi,
on this date I would like to publish a special plugin:
The Twin Towers of the former World Trade Center in New York City.

Today is the 16th anniversary of one of the most severe terror attacks in history which took thousands of lives. Their aftermath caused even more suffering and influences global politics even up to this day.
During my childhood, the Twin Towers of the WTC had always been sort of the epitome of a skyscraper. Whenever I heard that term "skyscraper", I had a picture of these towers in my mind, and I still admire their clean and elegant architecture today. Therefore, I thought it fitting to release this plugin on this date in order to commemorate the towers and the events that will always be connected to them.

The Set consists of two separate plugins which will appear in the award menu. The first plugin includes the two towers, each on a 4x4 lot and the second includes some 1x1 park tiles and a 2x2 sculpture. The tree on one of the 1x1 lots was made by Lobby and Theo.
All buildings require the rank "big city" to be built, and the towers can only be built once.

Note also that the towers are not to scale, even though they exceed the recommended maximum building height for plugins of 256px by far. This extreme height has the downside of causing the buildings to pop in or out of view quite abruptly at the bottom of the screen in lower zoom stages when you scroll across the map. If that bothers you, don't download this plugin!

PLEASE, do not start any political discussions below!
I understand that this subject might be controversial, but this is not the right place for any of that.

Thank you!
